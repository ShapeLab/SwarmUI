# Zooids: Building Blocks for Swarm User Interfaces \\  Extended Material
![Teaser](/Images/Teaser3.png)
This paper introduces swarm user interfaces, a new class of human-computer interfaces comprised of many autonomous
robots that handle both display and interaction. We describe the design of Zooids, an open-source open-hardware platform
for developing tabletop swarm interfaces. The platform consists of a collection of custom-designed wheeled micro
robots each 2.6 cm in diameter, a radio base-station, a highspeed DLP structured light projector for optical tracking, and
a software framework for application development and control. We illustrate the potential of tabletop swarm user interfaces
through a set of application scenarios developed with Zooids, and discuss general design considerations unique to swarm user interfaces.
